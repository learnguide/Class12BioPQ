What are the specific actions of FSH, LH, estrogen & progesterone in menstrual cycle? Ans. During menstrual phase of menstrual cycle which starts on 28th day the endometrial lining of female genital tract break down due to lack of progesterone As a result bleeding occurs. This monthly flow of blood is caller menstruation. During menstrual cycles, the various changes occurs in the ovary under the influence of various hormones :-1. Menstrual phase :- The levels of hormones LH ,FDH estrogen & progesterone is very less which results in breakdown of endometrial lining of uterus. 2. Follicular phase :- In this phase , the levels of pituitary hormones FSH & LH increases which causes ovarian hormone estrogen to release,. FSH controls the follicular phase , it stimulates the growth of follicles. Both FSH & LH reach their peak level in middle of cycle (14th day) 3. OVULATORY PHASE :- The level of LH hormones reaches its peak (called LH swing) induces the ruptures of mature Graffian follicle & there by release of ovum 4.

The trophoblast differentiates into two layers outer layer secretes enzymes to dissolve the endometrium of uterus. 2. The inner layer grows out as finger – like projections called chorionic villi into uterine stoma. The chorionic villi & the uterine tissue become inter digitated to form structural & functional unit called placenta. 3. Placenta secretes hormones like HCG, HPL , estrogen & progesterone that are necessary to maintain pregnancy 4. Umbilical cord, the structure that connects the placenta with the foetus is formed. 5. Simultaneously, inner cell mass differentiates into outer layer called ectoderm & inner layer called endoderm. & a middle layer called mesoderm appears between ectoderm & endoderm. 6. The primary germ layers give rise to all the tissues & organs of the adults e.g. after one month heart is formed & after second month digits & limbs are formed. 7. By the end of ninth month of pregnancy, foetus is completely developed & is ready for delivery. 8. During parturition, ovary secretes a hormone called relaxin that facilitates parturition which softens the connective tissue. Mild contraction called foetal ejection reflex is induced. This triggers release of oxytocin from posterior pituitary.

The zygote is then transferred into uterus or fallopian tube this process is called embryo transfer (ET) 2. Gamete Intra fallopian Transfer (GIFI) :- It involves transfer of an ovum collected from a donor female into another female who cannot produce ova but can provide suitable condition for fertilization 3. Artificial Insemination: - In this method semen is collected from the husband or a healthy donor & is artificially introduced into vagina or uterus. 13. Briefly explain the various reproductive technologies to assist an infertile couple to have children. Ans. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) includes in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT), and frozen embryo transfer (FET). These techniques also apply to oocyte donation and gestational carriers. Approximately 99 percent of ART cycles performed are IVF-ET. IVF-ET has helped many couples conceive successfully. ART may be recommended when other treatments (such as intrauterine insemination) have not been successful or when there is severe male factor infertility, severe endometriosis or tubal obstruction. 10 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 5 Principles of Inheritance and Variation 1 Marks Questions 1.

What does the lac operon consist of? How is the operator switch turned on and off in the expression of genes in this operon? Explain. Ans. Lac Operon consists of the following : Structural genes : z, y, a which transcribe a polycistronic mRNA. gene ‘z’ codes for b-galactosidase gene‘y’ codes for permease. gene‘a’ codes for transacetylase. Promotor : The site where RNA polymerase binds for transcription. Operator : acts as a switch for the operon Repressor : It binds to the operator and prevents the RNAPolymerase from transcribing. Inducer : Lactose is the inducer that inactivates the repressor by binding to it. Allows an access for the RNA polymerase to the structural gene andtranscription. 16 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint 3. What is an operon? Describe the major steps involved in an operon? Ans. Operon is a group of controller & structural genes which controls the catabolism of the cell geneticallyeg lactose operon / lac operon. (i) When inducer or lactose is absent :-The lac regulator gene synthesize a repressor protein by transcription & translation. This repressor protein binds with operator site of lac operon & blocks RNA polymerase. Thus, RNA polymerase unable to transcribe mRNA & structural gene unable to translate enzyme B-galactosidase. (ii) When inducer or lactose is present :_ The lac regulator gene transcribe mRNA &synthesise active lac repressor protein & at the same time lactose is converted into isomer allolactose. Allolactose binds to active lac repressor due to which it is converted to inactive repressor. This inactive repressor is released from operator site of lac operon & RNA polymerase binds to promoter & starts to transcribe mRNA & forms β-galactosidase are which converts lactose into glucose &galactose. Thus, presence of lactose determines whether or not lac. Repressor is bound to operator & genes are expressed on not. 17 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint 4.What do you mean semi conservative nature of DNA replication. Who proved it & how? Ans.

Distinguish between convergent and divergent evolution giving one example of each. Ans. Divergent Evolution - Development of different functional structures from a common ancestral form is called divergent evolution. Homologous organs show divergent evolution. Examples: Darwin's Finches, Australian Marsupials, locomotion in mammals. Convergent Evolution - Development of similar adaptive functional structures in unrelated groups of organisms is called convergent evolution. Analogous organs show convergent evolution. Examples: Australian Marsupials and Placental mammals, various aquatic vertebrate and wings of insect, bird and bat. 3 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint 3. What is adaptive radiation? Explain with an example. Ans. Adaptive radiation is an evolutionary process that produces new species from a single, rapidly diversifying lineage. This process occurs due to natural selection. An example of adaptive radiation is Darwin finches, found in Galapagos Island. A large variety of finches is present in Galapagos Island that arose from a single species, which reached this land accidentally. As a result, many new species have evolved, diverged, and adapted to occupy new habitats. These finches have developed different eating habits and different types of beaks to suit their feeding habits. The insectivorous, blood sucking, and other species of finches with varied dietary habits have evolved from a single seed eating finch ancestor. 4. How did Louis Pasteur disprove spontaneous generation theory? Ans. Louis Pasteur showed that in pre-sterilized flasks, life did not come from killed yeast while in another flask open to air, new organisms arose from ‘killed yeast. 5.Define homologous organs?

How do Darwin and Hugo de Vries after regarding Mechanism of Evolution? Ans. Darwin : Darwinian variatious are gradual, small and directional Hugo deVries : put forth idea of mutations, mutations are sudden random and directional 3. With the help of suitable diagram, represent the operation of naturalselection on different traits. Ans. Natural selection is one of the basic mechanisms of evolution, along with mutation, migration, and genetic drift. Darwin's grand idea of evolution by natural selection is relatively simple but often misunderstood. To find out how it works, imagine a population of beetles: 1. There is variation in traits. For example, some beetles are green and some are brown. 2. There is differential reproduction. 18 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint Since the environment can't support unlimited population growth, not all individuals get to reproduce to their full potential. In this example, green beetles tend to get eaten by birds and survive to reproduce less often than brown beetles do. 3. There is heredity. The surviving brown beetles have brown baby beetles because this trait has a genetic basis. 4. End result: The more advantageous trait, brown coloration, which allows the beetle to have more offspring, becomes more common in the population. If this process continues, eventually, all individuals in the population will be brown. If you have variation, differential reproduction, and heredity, you will have evolution by natural selection as an outcome. It is as simple as that. 4.What does Oparin – haldane hypothesis about origin of life suggests. Ans.

Ans. Humoral immune response is one in which antibodies are developed which are capable of attacking microbes. Each B-cell has receptors on its surface that recognize a specific antigen. Initial exposure of B-cell to Antigen triggers B-cells to proliferate forming a large clone cell continuous stimulation increases the number of B-lymphocytes which differentiates into smaller antibody producing plasma cells. Each clone of plasma cells manufactures antibodies that specifically react with antigenic determinant that stimulated the initial proliferation. The antibody binds to antigen- forming an antigen-antibody complex which is later digested by phagocytic cells. Some of these plasma cells develops into memory cells which rapidly differentially into plasma cells on later exposure to same antigen. 9 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint 9.It was diagnosed by a specialist that the immune System of the body of a patient has been suppressed.

This kind of curve is observed in the case of under population of reindeer growing in apredator free natural environment having plenty of food. In this case, the curve formed is J-curvethe small population first takes time to adjust into new environment so there is no increase in thepopulation. Once they get adapted they multiply exponentially. This growth & multiplicationcontinues so far the food is available. After sometime the food supply becomes less as compared tothe population increases. This causes mass starvation & mortality & results in the formation of Jshaped curve. The J-shaped growth form is described by equation 4.Describe the logistic growth model of population along with a suitable curve. Why is this curve more realistic? Ans. The logistic growth curve shows a sigmoid or a S-shaped curve. It has three phases:-17 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint (i) Lag-phase :- It is the early phase of little or no growth. Lag phase is one in which under population of cells adapt to or stablises with the growth conditions before embarking up their multiplication. (ii) Log phase or Exponential phase :- It is the middle phase of rapid or geometric rise, Once stabilized cells starts to multiply rapidly when the small population is stablised, the multiply becomes faster because of the plenty amount of food & other requirements of life. (iii) Stationary phase or steady phase:- Soon after the amount of food decreases in proportion to the number of cells & this results in the onset of stationary phase. During this phase, the number of new cells produced is roughly equal to the number of cells dead & so there is no net increase in the number of cells. Sigmoid growth curve is demonstrated by fo K – carrying capacity R – biotic potential 5.Give an example to show that completely unrelated species can also compete for same resources? Ans.

India occupies 2-4% of total land area of would but in terms of biodiversity, India contributeabout 10-35% of global diversity. A large number of species is native of India. About 5000 species of flowering plants belonging to 141genera& 47 families had a birth in India. There are 62% of amphibian species& 50% of lizards endemicto our country with large number in Western Ghats. India is an origin place of 166 species of crop plants& 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crop. India is rich in marine biodiversity lying along coastlineof 7500 km. There are two hotspots located in India out of 25 in would – These are Western Ghats&Eastern Himalayas. 10.What is the significance of Biodiversity to Human beings? Ans .Biodiversity provide numerous direct or indirect services to human beings. These are-i) Source of food & improved varieties:- Biodiversity directly or indirectly adds as the source of food,cloth& shelter. ii) Fats & Oils:- A variety of plants are used to extract different kinds of oils. 13 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint iii) Fibres:- A variety of plants eg. cotton, hemp, jute are chief sources of fibres. iv) Resins:- Resins are sticky exudation of plants. v) Gums, Timber, Paper, Tannins, Dyes:- Plants species provide variety of useful products eg. gums,raisins, dyes, similarly animal species provide leather, fur, honey, silk, pearl etc. vi) Drugs & Medicines:- Hiving organism also contain number of therapeutically useful substances. vii) Stability of Ecosystem:- The food web, food chain energy flow in various tropic level & biochemicalcycles occurs in natural ways without any hindrance if there is proper availability of diversified species viii) Aesthetic, Scientific & Recreational values :- Indian people grow many plants because they regardthem as sacred. 5 Marks Questions 1. Why is the sobriquet ‘The Evil Quartet’ used in context of biodiversity? Name the members of this quartet. Why do we grieve for the genes when a species is lost? Ans .The ‘Evil Quartet’ is used as a sobriquet to refer to the cause of loss ofbiodiversity : 14 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint (i) Habitat loss and fragmentation :When large habitats are broken up into smaller fragments due to various human activities, the animals requiring large territories (elephants, birds etc.) are badly affected and their populations decline. (ii) Over-exploitation :When need of a resource becomes greed. e.g., over exploitation of passenger pigeon led to its extinction. Also marine fish is at brink of being endangered due to over exploitations. (iii) Alien species invasion :Intentional or non-Intentional introduction of a species to a nearby area may disturb the harmony of existing species. e.g., Eichhornia after introduction posed a big threat to thenative species. (iv) Co-extinction :Extinction of one species invariably leads to extinction of another when they are associated with each other in an obligatory way . e.g., when host species is extinct, obligate parasites dependent on it also die. (v) We grieve for the loss of genes, because the wild forms are hardy and more resistant to pathogen attack and can be beneficial in crop breeding programmes. 2. Describe at least two approaches each for ex-situ conservation and in situ conservation as a strategy for biodiversity conservation. Ans . In situ conservation : (i) Identification and maximum protection of ‘hot spots’ (ii) Legal protection to ecologically rich areas. (iii) Biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries (iv) Sacred groves. Ex situ Conservation : 15 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint (i) Creation of zoological parks, botanical garden, wild life sanctuary (ii) Cryopreservation (iii) Seed bank. 3.Mention the major causes for loss of biodiversity? Ans .The four major causes for loss of Biodiversity are :-i) Habitat loss & fragmentation of crops or conversion into grassland for raising beef-cattle. Total loss ofhabitat deprives many plants & animals their hone & they face extinction. Similarly when a large Habrabecomes fragmented, animals requiring large territory& those with migratory habits are adverselyaffected. ii) Over exploitation :- when nature is over-exploited be man for natural resources, many speciesbecome extinct. iii) Invasion of alien species:- The alien species became invasive & compete with native species & causeextinction of indigenous species. iv) Co-extinction:- Co-extinction is a phenomenon in which when a species become extinct, the plant &animal species associated with it in an obligatory manner & become extinct 16 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 16 Environmental Issues 5 Marks Questions 1. Pollutant released due to human activities (like effluents from industries and homes) can radically accelerate the ageing process of the water body . (a) Explain how does this process occurs during natural ageing of lake. (b) Give the term used for accelerated ageing of water bodies. Also give the term used for the natural ageing of lake. Ans. (a) The phenomeon is eutrophication. More nutrients in water , aquatic life increases organic remains deposited on lake bottom, lake grows shallower and warmer, gradually transforms into land due to deposition of silt and organic debris. (b) Cultural or Accelerated eutrophication Natural ageing is Eutrophication. 2. In Arcata, the town’s people have created an integrated waste water treatment process within a natural system. Acitizen group called FOAM helps in upkeep of this project. (a) What are the main steps in waste water management done in this way? (b) ‘Ecosan’ in Kerala and Sri Lanka is also an intiative for water conservation. How? Ans. (a) Conventional sedimentation, filtering and chlorine treatment.Absorption and assimilation of pollutants by algae fungi and bacteria. (b) ‘Ecosan’ derived from ecological sanitation. Handling human excreta using dry composting toilets. Its practical, hygienic and cost effective method. 3. What are the contribution of Ahmed Khan in Bangalore and Ramesh Chandra Dagar 1 LearnGuide.in ","Onlinexampoint in Sonipat? Ans .Integrated organic farming is a cyclical, zero-waste procedure, where waste products from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other processes. This allows the maximum utilisation of resource and increases the efficiency of production. Ramesh Chandra Dagar , a far mer in Sonipat, Haryana, is doing just this. He includes bee-keeping, dairy management, water harvesting, composting and agriculture in a chain of processes, which support each other and allow an extremely economical and sustainable venture. There is no need to use chemical fertilisers for crops, as cattle excreta (dung) are used as manure. Crop waste is used to create compost, which can be used as a natural fertiliser or can be used to generate natural gas for satisfying the energy needs of the farm. Enthusiastic about spreading information and help on the practice of integrated organic farming, Dagar has created the Haryana Kisan W elfareClub, with a current membership of 5000 farmers. 4.i) What is meant by ozone shield? ii) Name two ozone depleting substances? iii) How do ozone depleting substances affect ozone shield? iv) Write one damaging effect of ozone – depletion on human & plants respectively? Ans.i) The ozone layer present in the atmosphere acts as an ultraviolet absorbent thus protectingthe earth from its harmful effect. The upper layer of atmosphere enveloped lay ozone is calledozone layer or ozone shield. ii) Chlorofluorocarbon used in aerosol propellant, fire extinguisher, refrigeration etc. iii) During depletion, the chlorine, fluorine, bromine, of CFCS & halogens are converted into reactivefree radical form lay photochemical reaction Cl or F are free to react with ozone disintegrating itinto O2 + O iv) In humans, it causes damage to DNA & mutations arise & also cause ageing of skin, damage toskin& skin cancer.In plants, it causes injury, premature death of plants & reduced growth & yield. 2 LearnGuide.in "]
